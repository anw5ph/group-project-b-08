# Study Buddy Finder

This is a full stack web application that incorporates PostgreSQL, Django Web Framework, Python, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. Additionally, the project uses Google Maps API for location services and the UVA Devhub API for course-related information. 

The purpose of the project was to give UVA students the opportunity to create and join study groups with fellow peers for exam preparation or just casual study sessions. Myself, along with 4 other computer science students completed this project while following an agile methodology. We begin by conducting interviews and questionnaires of our friends and random students to get a feel for the requirements that this site should have. From there, we began to design and create the website while completing detailed documentation and engaging in weekly stand-up meetings throughout the process.
